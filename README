This Java application transforms an Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx, Excel 2007+) into an XML file.
Uses the Apache POI libraries for Java (https://poi.apache.org/).

Usage: java -jar excel2xml.jar -f fileName [-split] [-xsl stylesheet]

The options are:
-f file name
[-split] - Split the output into separate files by worksheet
[-xsl stylesheet] - An optional XSL stylesheet to post-process the output files.

Files are output to the ./output directory.

The XML output has the format of:
   xml
      table
      	head
	  cell
        row
	  cell
			
If you post-process the file with XSLT, the post-processed files are also created 
in the ./output directory, and they have an additional .out extension.
